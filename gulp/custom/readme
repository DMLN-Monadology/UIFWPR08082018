This is where you put the custom gulp tasks.

Existing gulp tasks can be overriden in two ways:
1. Entire file
   - Simply create a new file in this folder with the same name as the one you wish to override
2. Single Task
   - To override a single task, create a new gulp task with the same task name as the one you wish to override and place it in this folder
