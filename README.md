# hs-core-ui

---
## HealthShare UI Framework is intended to be used across multiple projects
*NOTE*: hs-core-ui not a standalone project -- it only contains common framework code. To become a standalone project, it needs to be complemented with application specific code. see: [Getting started](#getting-started))

---
## prerequisites:
1. Make sure you've read both [hs-core-tools](https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-tools/blob/master/README.md) and [hs-core-ui](https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-ui/blob/master/README.md) README.md files
2. Make sure you've installed [hs-core-tools] and its [prerequisites](https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-tools/blob/master/README.md#requirements)

*Note* that if you are creating a modified build of your application, you should not modify these files. If you do, you risk them being overwritten on routine updates.

---
## Getting Started
*WARNING* the following instructions will fail if these [prerequisites](#prerequisites) were not satisfied.

### For framework developers
```
    #clone repo && switch to folder
    git clone https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-ui.git 
    cd hs-core-ui
    
    #install dependencies (bower/npm)
    slush hs:install
```    
### For app developers
```
    #clone repo && setup upstream && push to destination repo && creat app specific code && install dependencies
    slush hs
    #once completed, make the necessary app specific changes then commit and push changes to origin master
    git add .
    git commit -m 'initial app code'
    git push origin master
```

---
##Run application
*note:* app specific commands requires app code

```bash
slush hs:install #installs npm and bower packages
gulp serve       #only app specific
```

Run tests:

```bash
gulp test        #only app specific. It runs test:common, test:components, and test:app
gulp test:common
gulp test:components
gulp test:app    #only app specific
```

Update framework: //make sure your workarea is clean 

```bash
slush hs:updateCore 
#create PR on GitHub
```

Override app.config.js (for specifying dev/deploy configurations):
```bash
gulp serve --config <any valid directory>/<anyFileName>.js #only app specific
```
The file can be located in any directory, and the file name is not important.

###FAQs
* **I am getting this error message ```slush: command not found```**
  * Make sure your envoronment satisfies all of the [prerequisites] and [hs-core-tools] is installed
  
* **This framework looks awesome, how do I create a fully functional application using this framework in a couple of minutes?**
  * We highly recommend leveraging our [hs-core-tools] to fecilitate the creation of your new application.
   
* **What are the differences between "src/app", "src/common" and "src/components"**
  * "src/common" is framework code and should only be updated directly by framework developers. It defines system wide behaviors such as session management, state authorization, page configuration, and etc.
  * "src/components" is a framework code and should only be updated directly by framework and edition developers. It defines different UI-Components (bootstrap, foundation for apps, angular material) and the different editions (US, UK, Chinese) utilizing for the selected UI-Component. 
  * "src/app" is application code should only be updated by application developers.  It contains application specific logic and pages.
  
* **I want to include a new bower package to my application, where should I install it?**
  * Application specific bower pakages should be installed under "src/app/" folder (don't install it in "src/common" and "src/components")
   
* **Now that I have bower package successfully installed in "src/app/" folder, how do I add it to the application?**
  * We use Gulp to automate build tasks. Application specific gulp configuration can be found at "gulp/app.json". You'll need to specify the file path of your bower package in "vendor.js" json property which is line 3 of "gulp/app.json" file.
  
* **How do I add a new javascript package which is not avaiable through bower?**
  * You'll need to paste your non-bower library js files in "src/app/assets/vendors/" folder. If this folder doesn't exist, create one.
  * You'll have to reference your js file in "gulp/app.json" configuration file under this key path: "module.assets.vendor.js" array.
  
* **How do I include a 3rd party css file in my application?**
  * The framework does not support *.css file extensions, you'll need to rename your *.css extension to *.scss (superset of css) and place your *.scss file in "src/app/assets/sass/" folder. Once your file is in the sass folder, add a reference to  "src/app/assets/sass/main.scss" file.
  
* **How do I control what gets outputted in the console?**
  * Open up your "src/app/modules/app.config.js" file and add/remove channels in 'devlogWhitelist' and 'devlogBlacklist' arrays. Note: "\*" means all channels.
  
* **How do I change the REST API's hostname and Port number?**
  1. You can change the hostname and PORT number inside of app config file located "src/app/modules/app.config.js" 
  2. You can use an alternate config file with ```gulp serve --config <any valid directory>/<anyFileName>.js```
  
* **How do I promote an application feature to the framework?** (Be sure your changes are in common/components folder)
  * **Scenario 1**: The code I want to promote to framework are all in their own commits
    * Create a new branch off upstream master ```git checkout -b <branch> upstream/master```
    * Cherry-pick the feature commits. For each of your commits in reverse chronological order (oldest first) 
        * ```git cherry-pick <commit-hash>```
            * if you have conflicts, resolve them first then continue ```git cherry-pick --continue```  
        * Once you have all the source code, commit the changes (if needed). 
    * Push the changes to upstream (not origin)  ```git push upstream <branch> ```
    * Create a Pull Request
  * **Scenario 2**: The code I want to promote to framework are commited but contains non-feature code
    * Create a new branch off upstream master ```git checkout -b <branch> upstream/master```
    * Cherry-pick the feature commits. For each of your commits in reverse chronological order (oldest first) 
        * ```git cherry-pick --no-ff --no-commit <commit-hash>```
            * if you have conflicts, resolve them first then continue ```git cherry-pick --continue```  
        * Remove all changes that's not part of your feature
        * Once you have all the source code, commit the changes
    * Push the changes to upstream (not origin)  ```git push upstream <branch>``
    * Create a Pull Request`
  * **Scenario 3**: The code I want to promote to framework have not been commited
    * Stash your changes ```git stash save "<message>"```
    * Create a new branch off upstream master ```git checkout -b <branch> upstream/master```
    * Apply your stashed changes ```git stash apply```
    * Resolve conflicts (if any)
    * Once you have all the source code, commit the changes
    * Push the changes to upstream (not origin)  ```git push upstream <branch> ```
    * Create a Pull Request
  * **Scenario 4**: The code I want to promote to framework are commited, and I can't easily isolate the commits. But the good news is, the code is all in my <localBranch>
    * Create a new branch off upstream master ```git checkout -b <branch> upstream/master```
    * Merge your <localBranch> into your <branch> without fast-forward and commit, which allows you to pick the changes you want ```git merge --no-ff --no-commit <localBranch>```
    * Remove the files/changes you don't want to promote to the framework
    * Once you have all the source code, commit the changes
    * Push the changes to upstream (not origin)  ```git push upstream <branch> ```
    * Create a Pull Request
    
* **I have an existing application and my framework is out of date. How can I upgrade my application's framework (cool slush way)?**
  1. Update your ```hs-core-tools``` by executing ```slush hs:update```
  1. Ensure you have a local git remote upstream is pointing to "https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-ui.git"
    1. execute ```git remote -v``` to ensure your project has a remote ```upstream``` mapping
    1. if "upstream" doesn't exist, run ```slush hs:addUpstream```
  1. execute slush hs:updateCore
  1. create a PR to merge this to your project's master branch
  2. Follow [changelog.md] instruction for post update changes
  
* **I have an existing application and my framework is out of date. How can I upgrade my application's framework (the old fashion way)?**
  1. Ensure you have a local git remote upstream is pointing to "https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-ui.git"
    1. execute ```git remote -v``` to check existing git remote repo mappings
    2. if "upstream" doesn't exist, add it by executing ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/intersystems/hs-core-ui.git```
  2. create a new branch off remote master ```git checkout -b framework-update origin/master```
  3. pull the framework into your branch ```git pull upstream master```
  4. resolve conflicts (if any) and commit
  5. update your node and bower packages (we recommend using [hs-core-tools] ```slush hs:install```)
  6. Follow [changelog.md] instruction for post update changes
  7. Verify your application still works
  8. commit your changes (if any)
  9. push to origin ```git push origin framework-update```
  10. create a PR to merge this to your project's master branch
  
* **How do I specify who is authorized to access my page (ui-router state)?**
  * Navigate to where you've defined the ui-router state for your landing page and update **roles** property.  For reference, see  **src/app/modules/login/login.module.js**
  
* **How do I specify a landing page for specific user role?**
  * Navigate to where you've defined the ui-router state for your landing page and add/update  **landingPageFor** property and include your user role as one of the array values. For reference, see  **src/app/modules/login/login.module.js**
  
* **How come when I successfully authenticated a user(Status Code 200 from REST API), nothing happens, I am still at the login page?**
  * That's because you haven't specified a landing page for the authenticated user role. You need to specifiy a landing page for your authenticated user's role. For reference, see  **src/app/modules/login/login.module.js**
  
* **I created a Pull-Request, but it won't let me merge it due to conflicts. How do I resolve this?**
  * merge the latest of origin master to your local branch  ```git pull origin master```
  * resolve conflicts
  * stage and commit your resolved changes  ```git commit -am '<your message>'```
  * Assume your branch is called "my-feature-branch". Push your changes to your tracked server branch  ```git push origin <my-feature-branch> ```
